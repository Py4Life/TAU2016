    "## 1) Parsing $\\lambda$ phage FASTQ\n",
    "The FASTQ file format is commonly used to store deep sequencing reads data. It is similar to the FASTA format, but includes additional information. Each record is represented by four lines:\n",
    "- Line 1 begins with a `@` character and is followed by a sequence identifier and an optional description (like a FASTA title line).\n",
    "- Line 2 is the raw sequence letters.\n",
    "- Line 3 is just a `+` character\n",
    "- Line 4 encodes the quality values for the sequence in Line 2, and must contain the same number of symbols as letters in the sequence.  \n",
    "Sequence quality is encoded with characters from:\n",
    "```\n",
    "!\"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where `!` represents the lowest quality, equivalent to a score of 1, and `~` is the highest quality with a score of 94.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The function given below translates the characters into their corresponding scores and returns a dictionary which you can use later. Make sure you understand how to work with this dictionary before proceeding. Note that we use the \\ character inside the string to include the quotation mark that follows it inside the string and not as a string ending (i.e., if we used only \" instead of \\\", the quotation mark tells python that this is the end of the string)."
